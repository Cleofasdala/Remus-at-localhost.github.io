				<h4>This is my first open source project, which is also uploaded to github and made available for the public
					 to use / modify under the norms of MIT licence. You can download the code for this project from 
					 <a href="https://github.com/Remus-at-localhost/Free_Surveillance_Debian">
						 <u>Here</u></a> & watch the demo of this system <a href="https://youtu.be/1G6cGH2-AvY?t=76">
							<u>Here</u></a>
					 . 
				</h4>
				<p><b>The Requirements -></b>
					You just need a spare android phone, a laptop with any debian distro that can run Metasploit. You'll also need to have Python3 and 
						libraries like pyautogui & requests installed in your system. Moreover
					for interacting with this system I've used a discord server where you can 
					input certain commands to remotely monitor your surveillance feed.
					<br />
					<b>How to set this up -></b>  1. Create a Discord Server and one text group within it, which will be dedicated thereafter for uploading the surveillance images and controlling the system through user-defined commands. 

					<br />2. Now make sure that you extract the [Access token] and [Group ID] of your Discord Server's text group. 
					Need Help extracting these 2, watch this -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy6RiosHKo0&t=15s">
						<b><u>Finding Access token and Group Id on Discord</u></b></a>
					
					<br />3. Once you have these 2 things, copy them to the [Token URL ID] file. 
					
					<br />4. Edit the changes in the Exploit (Bash script) file [edit Listening Port and Listening Host]. Now run the Start script once all changes are made.

			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/discord.gif" alt="" /></span><h4>As you can see the phone (surveillance camera) is placed strategically behind the front
			door of my house and it's connected to my home network (wifi), whereas my laptop is also connected to the same network.</h4></p>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/door.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4><u>The Working-></u> As soon as I run the Start.py script on the laptop 
					this script initiates the process and runs two more scripts parralelly [exploit.sh & Main.py]. then the laptop attempts to
				gain the Reverse TCP shell access of that phone using metasploit and once that is done the system informs the user to send the
			START command to begin the 2nd phase of automation. Once the system is ready to send images of the live feed it prompts the 
		user to send SHOW | CONT | SHUTDOWN commands. The Exploit.sh is a 
		bash script which automates some metasploit commands and the Main.py is a script which interactes with the user by 
	sending system messages related to the system and recieving commands given by the user(s) through the discord server.

	<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/PC.jpeg" alt="" /></span><h4><u>How I use this? -> </u>Whenever I have to go out, 
		I just place my spare android phone behind the front door, then I make sure that this phone & my laptop are connected 
	to the same network(home wifi).Then I just start the {Start.py} script on the laptop and then I can go out and control 
	this system on the go through discord app on my mobile. </h4>
